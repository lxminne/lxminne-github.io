    <p>
        Garage sale is the first, and longest, game development project I’ve worked on thus far! What started out as a small bitsy project has grown into a years-long endeavor. We released the game last year, which you can check out <a hfref="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2104990/Garage_Sale/"> on this Steam page!</a>
        I’ve worked as the lead artist for the project, as well as a designer and writer.

    <h3 id="my art">Here are a few of the portraits I created for the game:</h3>
    <img src="images/nadiaportrait.png" alt="A pixel art portrait of Nadia, a sweet kid who's passionate about journalism. She has a blue and green striped sweater, dark skin, bright hair clips, and dark hair tied up in 2 little buns.">
    <img src="images/gamerboypng.PNG" alt="A pixel art portrait of Xavier, a dog who loves to play video games.">
